Regular expressions
===================

A regular expression (regex or regexp for short) is a special text string for describing a search pattern. You can think of regular expressions as wildcards on steroids. You are probably familiar with wildcard notations such as ``*.txt`` to find all text files in a file manager. The regex equivalent is ``.*\.txt$``. [1]_
